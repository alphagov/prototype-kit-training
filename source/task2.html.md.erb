# Task 2: adding questions to your pages

## Main task 

Follow the tutorial on how to [add questions to your question pages](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/make-first-prototype/add-questions).

## Stretch task

### Add more components to your pages

Look through the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) for components to add to some of your pages. Fill them with relevant juggling content.

We recommend using the following components:

* [details](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/)
* [inset text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/)
* [warning text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/warning-text/)

Do not add anything that will change the overall flow or functionality of the prototype, as it will make it harder to keep up later in the training.
