# Using the terminal and git

## The terminal

The command line is a text interface for your computer. Just like Windows
Explorer on a PC or Finder on a Mac, it lets you navigate through the files
and folders of your computer, but it's completely text-based.

The command line can seem unfamiliar and scary, but it's really a
different way of interacting with your computer. This tutorial only covers
safe commands that will not do anything bad to your computer, even if you get
them wrong.

Terminal is only available in Mac OS X. For Windows, use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

### Navigating around in the terminal

Once you've opened your terminal you should see a window.

Do not worry if the text in yours is a little different. It does not matter.

To run a command, type the words and press `Enter`.

Try running:

```shell
pwd
```

#### `pwd` or print working directory

The `pwd` command prints to the command line the current directory (another
name for folder) you are in. If you just opened up your terminal, you are
probably in your 'home' directory, and you should get an output similar to this:

```shell
/Users/your-username
```

So your current 'working directory' is `/Users/your-username`.

#### `cd` or change directory

The `cd` command allows you to move between directories. You tell `cd` which directory to move to by putting the path after the `cd`, like this:

```shell
cd Desktop
```

This moves you into the Desktop directory.

You can go up a directory level:

```shell
cd ..
```

You can also go to your home directory.

```shell
cd ~
```

#### `ls` or list

The `ls` command lists the files in a directory:

```shell
ls
```

This should print a list of the files and folders inside the working directory. If you're in your home directory, you'll probably see directories like `Applications`, `Desktop`, `Documents` and `Downloads`.


### Terminal shortcuts

Use **Up** and **Down** to go through previous commands.

Select **Ctrl** and **C** together to cancel a running command.

Select **Command** and **K** together to clear your terminal. This does not stop a running command. It removes lines of content from view.

Select **Tab** to autocomplete a file or folder name. You may need to press it a second time if there are no unambiguous matches.

### Getting things wrong in the terminal

If you type a command that the command line does not understand, it will show you an error message. Do not worry if you see one of these. Have a look at the command you wrote and see if you can work out what was wrong.

Try the following for example:

```shell
whargleblargle
```

You should see an error message like:

```shell
-bash: whargleblargle: command not found
```

## Common Git commands

### Create a repository

A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed. 

Create a new local repository with the specified name:

```shell
git init PROJECT-NAME
```

Download a project and its entire version history:

```shell
git clone PROJECT-URL
```

### Make changes

List all new or modified files to be committed:

```shell
git status
```

Snapshot the file in preparation for versioning:

```shell
git add FILE-NAME
```

Snapshot multiple files:

```shell
git add .
```

Record a snapshot of your file (a commit):

```shell
git commit -m MESSAGE-THAT-EXPLAINS-YOUR-COMMIT
```

### Synchronise local and remote repos

Upload all local branch commits to GitHub:

```shell
git push REMOTE-BRANCH-NAME BRANCH-NAME
```

If pushing to a master branch from a local repo (a folder on your device), you can write the above as:

```shell
git push origin master
```

Download history from a remote directory and incorporate the changes in your local version:

```shell
git pull
```

### Branches

Git branches are a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. If you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, you can create a new branch to encapsulate your changes.

List all local branches in the current repository:

```shell
git branch
```

Create a new branch:

```shell
git branch BRANCH-NAME
```

Switch to the specified branch and update working directory:

```shell
git checkout BRANCH-NAME
```

Combine the specified branch’s history into the current branch:

```shell
git merge BRANCH-NAME
```
